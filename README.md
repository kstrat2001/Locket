# Locket for iOS #

Locket is a free app on the iTunes App Store

[GET THE APP HERE](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/locket/id306891305?mt=8) 

See my other repo for the server `locket_server`

Locket accesses the images and data from my personal Amazon AWS account.
You will need your own S3 account to set up the paperclip back end to store lockets
Also, feel free to use the default settings which will access my server

### How do I get set up? ###

Pods are checked in so a `pod install` should not be necessary

 * Open the `Locket.xcworkspace` file (not the xcodeproj file)
 * Build and run

### Open Source ###

Locket is released under the MIT license.  See LICENSE.md for more details.
